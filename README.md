# Hubitat-HomeConnect
Home Connection appliances integration for Hubitat

# What can I do with this driver?
Here is a list of currently supported appliances (not all appliances are fully supported):

CoffeeMaker<br>
Dishwasher<br>
Dryer<br>
FridgeFreezer<br>
Hob<br>
Hood<br>
Oven<br>
Washer<br>
WasherDryer<br>

# Installation
The easiest way to install it is to use "Hubitat Package Manager". The steps necessary to access your appliances are written in the APP.

# Note
I did this on my free time and for sure there are bugs so use it at your own risk. Some of the features are not yet supported (I just own the dishwasher so I can't really test it on other appliances). If other developers are willing to add better support for the other appliances, just send me a pull request :)

# Credits
This was all possible due to the work done by https://github.com/Wattos/hubitat to support the Homme Connect API.
And of course, the Hubitat dev community! If you want to buy me a beer please [click here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=GNAVZ94NC3FQL&currency_code=CAD)
